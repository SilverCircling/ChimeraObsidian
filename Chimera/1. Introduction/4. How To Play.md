Chimera as a system is a medium for storytelling accounting for a vast amount of situations, but the most basic representation of a session is as follows:
1. **The GM describes the relevant environment and scenario.** From describing the star speckled night sky seen through the collapsed ceiling of an old world parking lot, to the appearance and demeanor of the caravanner you've run into taking refuge there. The GM is the world, and the world is the GM. Every person, place, or thing that isn't a player character is under the GM's purview.
2. **The players react to the situation and information provided by the GM.** One player might want to speak with the caravanner, one player might want to start a fire, and one player might want to try stealing from the caravanner's goods while they aren't looking. The GM will ask for an associated die roll if warranted, and the players will tell the GM their result. In a TTRPG, you can basically do anything within the confines of the rules and your imagination!
3. **The GM describes the results of the players actions.** The GM interprets the results of the dice and narrates the outcome. The caravanner spins tales of battles fought in a world forgotten, the campfire breathes life fueled by foraged vegetation, and a mysterious bag is knabbed from the caravanner's dredger while they're distracted. Once the players interact with what has been provided the outcomes are what separates a pretty mental picture from a living, breathing world.
It is this main premise and gameplay loop that makes the base that all stories told in Chimera are founded on. But there's more to it than that because otherwise you're just roleplaying with your friends!

**The Dice**
Dice are the governing factor in all things that can be attempted in the game, from shooting a gun at an enemy to haggling for better prices on ammo afterward. Most things are done with a pool of d10s (10 sided dice) from which the GM asks a player roll to determine the success or failure of an action. For the most part, these pools of d10s are derived from your Trait Dice that you pick during character creation. These dice that are rolled must be equal to or greater than the pre-determined victory threshold, or commonly referred to as VT, to succeed. Some other types of dice are used for things like determining the damage of an attack or other variant things but primarily the d10 is the most commonly used die.
For example, John needs to roll a VT of 14 to succeed in holding up a collapsing piece of rubble so his compatriots can pass through safely. John has 2d10 in his Strength Trait dice pool so the chances of rolling a 14 aren't on his side. He rolls and gets a total of 9 and fails to hold up the rubble, causing it to collapse and block the party's way forward.

**Victory Thresholds**
Determining the success or failure of all things in Chimera are measured by victory thresholds, abbreviated to VT for short. Most general actions have pre-determined victory thresholds with equations tied to them for quick calculation. Something like attempting to jump over a chasm, for example, already has rules for how difficult that might be tied into the foundation of the game. But it is *very* important to remember that every situation is different and it is well within the GM's power to adjust accordingly. Maybe something like slick mud from recent rain has made the jump more difficult, and the GM may increase the VT accordingly. Some VTs are made on the spot, such as the rubble John attempted to catch. There's no rules for the difficulty of catching a falling object or holding it in place, so the GM in this scenario ruled that because of the large size and weight of the object it was difficult, warranting a spit-balled VT of 14.
There are two separate types of VTs, passive VTs and challenge VTs. A passive VT is the required number to succeed on an action without being challenged by an outside force. A common example of a passive VT is a creature's Hit VT which represents how difficult it is to hit without the creature doing something to prevent it such as dodging or blocking. A challenge VT is the required number to succeed on an action that opposes another creature's success. A common example of a challenge VT is once an attack meets or exceeds a creature's Hit VT the number rolled is the set challenge VT for if a creature wants to attempt making a defensive action. The challenge VT in this instance represents how accurate the attack was against the creature, and now how difficult it would be to make it miss with a defensive action.

**Poise**
Poise is a pool of points from which players expend to do just about every action in the game. Attacking costs poise, physical exertion costs poise, socializing costs poise, and so on. Poise can also be used to succeed on rolls that would've otherwise failed. When a creature fails to reach a VT after making a roll they can choose to spend a number of Poise equal to how much they missed the VT by to instead succeed.
Let's go back to that same scenario with John for an example of what he could've done. John's Trait Roll was a 9 which failed to reach the VT of 14 to hold up the rubble. In order to make the initial roll John spent 3 Poise points but his roll unfortunately failed. Instead of failing John could instead choose to expend 5 more of his Poise to reach the VT and succeed instead.
Spending too much Poise has heavy negative consequences on a character's well being. Depending on how much Poise a character has they will begin suffering from Poise Fatigue.

**Degrees of Success | The Poise Flowchart**
Rather than simply succeeding or failing there are four possible degrees of success when making a roll, critical failure, failure, success, and critical success. When making a roll to reach a VT, critical failure or critical success is a possibility and can greatly sway the result of the roll. The success or failure of an action is ascribed by the action itself, but critical success and critical failure have specific effects. On a critical success, actions with a Poise point cost over 1 instead cost 1PP regardless of how much it normally costs, and a critical success on an action that deals damage doubles the damage dealt. Modifier damage is not doubled, only the damage dice. On a critical failure, the Poise point cost for the action is doubled. Some actions have specific consequences or advantages upon rolling either a critical failure or critical success. You can only expend Poise points to reach the next subsequent degree of success on the poise flowchart. There is one exception however, you cannot make a success into a critical success. You must roll a critical success on its own without additional poise expenditure.

**Poise Fatigue & Final Will**
When a creature reaches 0 Poise points it suffers from Poise Fatigue. Poise Fatigue is an extremely debilitating status effect that makes success much more difficult the more it worsens, and can even knock a creature Unconscious if it becomes too extreme. When a creature has 0 or a negative amount of Poise points it cannot expend additional Poise points to succeed on failed rolls. Additionally, for every Poise point that the creature is negative it must subtract that number from *all* its rolls besides damage rolls. A creature that meets or exceeds its Poise point minimum becomes Unconscious for 8 hours during which the Unconscious status effect cannot be ended in any other way. A creature's Poise Point minimum is equal to half its Poise point maximum as a negative number. (Ex: a creature with a Poise point maximum of 40 has a Poise point minimum of -20)
Sometimes during dire circumstances players might need to take desperate measures to succeed. If a situation proves drastic enough a player with 0 or negative Poise points, or that is currently dying, can invoke their "Final Will" which emboldens a player character with one final boost of adrenaline at the cost of their life. Once a player invokes their Final Will it begins at the start of their next turn. For the duration their character has twice their normal Trait Dice, all actions cost 0 Poise and are not reduced by Poise Fatigue, and their first successful Strike action against a creature becomes a critical success instead. Additionally, invoking Final Will ends the Dying status effect. Once their turn ends, they begin dying which when dying in this specific way *death cannot be prevented*.

**Modifier Dice**
Some actions and abilities apply modifier dice onto a roll. Modifier dice can be either Positive Dice or Negative Dice, both of which are d6s (6 sided dice). They are called into play to provide a positive boon or negative penalty to a roll. Positive Dice are boons to your roll. When applied to a roll the die is added to your total to give a higher chance of success. Negative Dice are penalties to your roll. When applied to a roll the die is subtracted from your total to give a lower chance of success. Opposing modifier dice are not cumulative and rather cancel each other out (Ex: a character that adds 1 Positive Die and 1 Negative Die to a roll simply rolls no modifier dice at all rather than rolling and applying both to the total). Multiple of the same type of modifier die are cumulative to a maximum of five after subtracting opposing dice.
Modifier dice are often not only added by mechanics of the game but are also frequently added by GMs when an action attempted by a player has special circumstances applied to it. For example, a player attempting to jump over a large gap which they don't have enough jumping tiles for has to make a roll to determine their success or failure. Sometimes specific circumstances effect said roll and the GM may adapt those circumstances into the probability of success or failure. Maybe recent rain has made the ground slick with mud so the GM applies a Negative Die, or another player character helps boost their jump and the GM applies a Positive Die.

**Expending Dice**
Almost all actions expend Trait Dice, but you do not need to spend *all* of them when making a roll allowing you to do more than just one Trait specific action in a turn (Ex: You can choose to strike with a Strength weapon and take the Block action on the same turn as long as you don't expend all your Strength dice on one or the other). If an action calls for a type of Trait Dice, you have to expend at least one die of the specified type to take the action. Once you choose how many dice you want to expend all roll them, you cannot roll more. That number is the result, unless changed with additional Poise point expenditure. You regain all expended Trait Dice at the end of the round.

**Round Down**
If something requires a number to be divided resulting in a fraction of any kind, always round down to the closest whole number.

**Rules Are Made To Be Broken**
While the general rules on things like combat for example are in depth and considered constant, many class abilities, prowesses, mods, etcetera make exceptions. This being said not only does the game itself break its own rules but you should too! One of the glorious things about TTRPGs is if you don't like something you don't have to be an experienced modder or game designer to change it.
