**What Are Adrenokin?**
	Adrenokin are humans who have undertaken a stressful, invasive, and extremely dangerous procedure unto their bodies to fully overdrive many aspects of themselves, primarily their adrenal system. This process includes the installation of a device commonly referred to as a "siphon". Only a small amount of people can undertake the extreme agony and taxation on the body this surgery inflicts. The installation of a siphon is so utterly devastating to the body a creature that survives this procedure is no longer recognized as human but rather a cyborg.
	After surviving the process of becoming an adrenokin, these newly created cyborgs gain access to a slew of abilities. A heightened sense of awareness, reaction speed, control over their emotions and fear responses, and overall greater bodily health. In many respects, becoming an overall superior version of an average human. But besides the passive benefits of the siphon, it's main purpose is much more aggressive in nature.
**Bound Weapons**
	Adrenokin hold a special relationship with their weapons. Through a long process of modification and tweaking adrenokin form a special connection with their weapon of choice. By connecting their siphon to their weapon adrenokin can use their own amplified adrenaline as a power source, temporarily empowering their weapon into a dangerous implement of destruction. This is the main utility of the siphon, and serves as the primary cause for a person to pursue becoming an adrenokin. Because of this reason almost all adrenokin are well versed in combat, whether for simply defending themselves, chimeran hunting, or for more nefarious purposes.
**Adrenaline Addicts**
	Because of the very nature of risking your life to become an adrenokin, they are most often adrenaline addicts of some nature. Adrenokin are avid risk takers, loving nothing more than the thrill of a dangerous situation. They thrive under pressure, and can't stand idling whether physically or mentally. An adrenokin must always be moving and thinking. Because of this they love competition and fighting, always itching for their next brush with death. Gambling is also a common trait among adrenokin, regardless of whether its petty pocket cash or their own life.
**Creating an Adrenokin**
	The most important thing to consider when creating an Adrenokin character is what drove you to undertake the process of becoming an adrenokin? Was there some threat to you or own loved one's safety that made risking your life worth it? Possibly just the enticement of the abilities the siphon grants was enough to drive you to risk everything? Maybe the procedure is a wright of passage in the community you grew up in? Or maybe you never even wanted to become one in the first place, and it was forced on you by some odd circumstance?
