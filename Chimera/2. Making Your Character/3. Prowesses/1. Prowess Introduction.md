**What Are Prowesses?**
	Prowesses are one of the primary ways in which your character progresses their skill when the level up. There are two types of Prowesses, Weapon Prowess and Social Prowess. Your Weapon Prowess represents a type of weapon with which you are very skilled at wielding. Your Social Prowess represents a type of archetype your character fits in social situations.

**Prowess Dice**
	When you have Prowess with a type of weapon or with a type of Social Trait you gain a Prowess Die. You gain additional Prowess Dice from leveling up. Prowess Dice are additional d10s that you can add to a roll using the weapon type or Social Trait with which you have Prowess. You can expend your Prowess Dice in addition to, or in place of, the Trait Dice expended as part of an action. Expended Prowess Dice come back at the end of a round.
