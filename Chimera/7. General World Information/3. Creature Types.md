**Types of Creature**
There are a multitude of differing types of creatures across the world, all with different classifications, physiologies, and abilities. The different creature types are described below:
- Angel - Otherworldly beings with psychic reality bending qualities and unknown origins
- Cyborg - Originally biological organisms that have been modified by/implanted with mechanical aspects to such a degree it can not survive independent of its mechanical parts
- Fauna - Animals; birds, reptiles, insects, humans and other mammals, etc.
- Flora - Plants; flowers, trees, vines, mosses, etc.
- Fungi - Mushrooms, yeasts, molds
- Machine - Robots; electronic or powered by other abiotic means
- Mutant - Creatures heavily mutated by the effects of radiation exposure, harmful or otherwise
- Slime - Typically large single celled organisms with amoeba like qualities
- Wisp - Ghost like in behavior and appearance, wisps are acellular organisms that exist solely to seek and consume the consciousness of sentient beings
Different creatures with the same creature type will often be very different from one another in behavior and abilities but will have basic similarities that link them to each other. For example, all Slimes have the "Amorphous" ability but aside from this similarity different types of Slimes can vary drastically from one another.
