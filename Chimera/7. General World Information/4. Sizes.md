**Size Information & Size Chart**
A creature's size plays an important role during combat and exploration. The average creature is Medium size and deviations from this size come with penalties or bonuses to the creature's Hit VT. They also take up differing amounts of tiles as described in the "Space" section. Aside from the basic information provided by the chart there are a few more general constants to take into consideration about a creature's size:
- A creature can move through another creature's space without being impeded regardless of whether it's willing or not if either creature is 2 or more size categories smaller than the other. Additionally, a creature can end its turn in another creature's space if either creature is 2 or more size categories smaller than the other.
- Any action or ability that forces involuntary movement, expenditure of tiles, or limits movement in some way such as the Trip, Tackle, Shove, or Throw actions made against a target of a different size apply 1 Negative die for every size category larger, and 1 Positive Die for every size category smaller.
- When using the Grapple action against a creature of a different size than yourself, the larger creature's movement is not reduced. If the creature is 2 or more size categories larger it cannot be moved with the Grapple action at all.
- A creature that is at least 2 size categories smaller than another creature can reasonably use that creature as full or partial cover as per a GM's ruling.
