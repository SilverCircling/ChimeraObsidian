**What Is Synergy?**
	Unpredictable but helpful, synergy is another tool under a player's belt to encourage inter-party strategy during combat. At the start of a combat encounter, after the Combat Coin has been flipped, each player rolls a d10 Synergy Die. Players who roll the same number as another player are considered synergized for the duration of the triggering combat encounter, gaining access to Synergy actions. Players who roll a number separate from any other player act individually. Player characters don't have access to Synergy actions until at least Synergy level one with a player character or creature they can synergize with. Creatures beside player characters do not have access to synergy unless otherwise specified. Additionally, you cannot be synergized with a creature on a different side from you during a combat.

**Synergy Actions**
	Once two or more players who are at least Synergy level one with each other are synergized they gain access to Synergy actions. Players can only use Synergy actions with creatures they're synergized with.
Spotting | 2 Poise points
	When taking the Spot action, choose any ally with which you are synergized and expend any number of Perception Trait Dice. The expended dice can be used in addition to or in place of any defensive action that the chosen creature takes until the start of your next turn. You must be able to sense and communicate with the target ally to take this action. If at any point you cannot sense or communicate with the target ally it loses the benefits granted by this action.
Covering | 3 Poise points
	When taking the Cover action, choose any ally with which you are synergized and can sense. Roll a Strength or Dexterity melee or Perception ranged weapon attack against a target creature. If the total meets or exceeds the target creature's Hit VT for all intents and purposes this attack is considered a Strike action. If the target creature takes a defensive action against this attack, regardless of whether it succeeds or not, it cannot make any attack actions against the chosen ally until the start of your next turn.
Flanking | 2 Poise points
	When taking the Flank action, choose any ally with which you are synergized and is positioned on the opposite side of a target creature from you. You most both be within melee range of the target creature. For every attack action that you make against the target creature during your turn the chosen ally applies 1 Positive Die to their next attack action against that creature until the start of your next turn. For every attack action that the chosen ally makes against the target creature during their turn you apply 1 Positive Die to your next attack action against the target creature.

**Making Friends | Synergy Progression**
	As your character gets to know the members of your party better your chance to synergize increases. For every in game day that you spend the majority of your time in the company of your companions, you gain one Synergy point. Your GM may also award Synergy points at the end of a combat as a reward for things like coordinating a well planned strategy or for doing something that saves another character from imminent danger. They might also reward Synergy points for intimate or outstanding inter-party roleplay moments.

	For every Synergy level you have with an ally after level one, your Synergy Die's margin of synergy increases by 1 on the roll. For example, two allies that are Synergy level one with each other must roll exactly the same number on their Synergy Die to synergize. Both roll to see if they synergize at the beginning of a combat, one rolls a 5 and the second rolls a 6. They do not synergize. But, in the same situation except the two allies are Synergy level two with each other they would synergize because they were only 1 number off from each other. This increases to a margin of 2 at level three, a margin of 3 at level four, and a margin of 4 at level five.

**Creating Your Own Synergy Actions**
	By default there are only three Synergy actions but you are extremely encouraged to strategize with your fellow players outside of combat to "craft" other Synergy actions. These can be literally anything so long as you communicate with your GM and work with them to create and balance them. Besides the increased chance to synergize when rolling your Synergy Dice, Synergy levels have another use. For every Synergy level you have with an ally you gain a "Synergy action slot" with them. These slots represent the total amount of Synergy actions you can have with an ally. These types of Synergy actions are ally specific, meaning you cannot "craft" an action with one ally with which it makes sense and then use it in tandem with a different ally. You can only use your ally specific Synergy actions when synergized with that ally.
