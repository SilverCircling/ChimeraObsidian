Hit Point Damage
	Once you've hit a target with a Strike action or other action/ability that does damage you roll the specified Damage Dice and add any applicable Damage Modifiers. The target's HP is reduced by the total amount.

Adding Damage Modifiers
	Some things that deal damage will have a flat damage modifier added to the Damage Dice. There are two types of damage modifier, general damage modifiers and weapon damage modifiers. General damage modifiers are modifiers that are simply added to the damage roll for the amount specified. They are not calculated from anything and are specifically tied to what specifies their use. Weapon damage modifiers are different from general damage modifiers because they are calculated using the weapon's associated Physical Trait Die type. When rolling for damage with a weapon, the weapon's damage modifier is equal to the amount of dice you have with that weapon's associated Trait Die type.
	For example, if a character has 3 Strength Dice and you make a damage roll with a Strength weapon, you add +3 to the weapon's Damage Dice result. So a Strength weapon that deals 1d8 damage and rolls a 5 adds +3 more damage for a total of 8 damage.
	Both general and weapon damage modifiers are the same type of damage as whatever they're being added to.

Dying & Death
	Once a creature reaches 0 HP it gains the Dying status effect. A Dying creature falls Prone once they receive this status effect, can't expend any movement tiles besides walking tiles, and cannot take any actions with a cost over 0 Poise points. Additionally, a Dying creature lasts a number of turns equal to the number of Constitution and Psyche Trait Dice it has combined. For every 5 damage a creature with this status effect takes it loses a turn. Once this amount of turns passes, the creature dies. This status effect can be ended by healing to at least 1 HP, or by another creature taking the Stabilize action on the Dying creature. A stabilized creature becomes Unconscious for 8 hours during which the Unconscious status effect cannot be ended in any other way.
	When a creature dies, it dies.

Hit Point & Poise Point Healing
	When you receive healing you simply add the specified amount and type back to your HP or Poise points. You cannot heal over your HP or Poise point maximum, and you cannot heal either once dead.

Temporary Hit Points & Poise Points
	Temp HP and PP takes priority before your normal HP and PP. Damage that's dealt to you reduces your temp HP before it reduces your normal HP, acting as a sort of temporary damage preventing barrier. Same applies to expending Poise points, temp PP takes priority. As the name implies all temp HP and PP is temporary and goes away after the specified amount of time passes or other condition is met. Temp HP and PP cannot be healed, and gaining temp HP or PP removes any other temp HP or PP you have.

Hit Point & Poise Point Maximum
	Some times things may reduce or increase your maximum HP or PP. All things that effect your maximum HP and PP are temporary besides increases from gaining more Hit Point Dice or Trait Dice from leveling. Things other than level increases that effect HP or PP will have a specified amount of time they last or condition that must be met before they end.
