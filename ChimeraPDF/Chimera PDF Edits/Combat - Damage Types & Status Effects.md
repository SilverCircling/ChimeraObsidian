Status Effects
There are many different types of status effect, some effect the mind like Frenzied or effect the body like Blinded. Some are effects applies by elements like Ablaze and Electrified. And some effects are very rare and specific to certain creatures or locations like Raptured or Irradiated. They all have one thing in common and that's that they are conditions a creature is actively suffering from. Some status effects have specific ways of ending them but most must be waited out for a specified time. A creature can only suffer from one instance of a given status effect at a time. Applying a status effect to a creature it already suffers from does not stack the status effect it just replaces it.
