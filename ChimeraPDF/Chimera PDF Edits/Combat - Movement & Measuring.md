Grid Combat
Grid Tiles
	Combat encounters are fought on maps with a grid of tiles over top. These tiles are the units of measurement which are used to judge distance. Each tile is considered to be 3x3 feet. Vertical movement on this grid is measured by 3x3x3 cubes, but still referred to as tiles for sake of ease.
Moving Your Character
	In order to move a creature must expend its tiles of movement. Creatures only have so many movement tiles they can expend during a round. At any point during their side a creature can use its movement tiles to move an equivalent amount on the map grid. Creatures get expended movement tiles back at the end of a round.
Measuring Distance
	Weapons and abilities, among other things, often have a maximum distance at which they can be used. This number of tiles is represented simply as its range. For example, most melee weapons have a range of 1 tile (1tl.).

Weapon Range
	Every weapon has a specified range that someone must be within to take an attack against a target. Unless otherwise specified, a melee attack means within 1 tile. Certain melee weapons can have further ranges but they are the minority. Ranged weapons have a lot more tiles than ranged weapons because they shoot projectiles. All ranged weapons have an effective range and a maximum range. Attacks made at effective range are made normally, attacks made over the effective range take a negative penalty to the roll equal to how many tiles further than effective range that the target is. This penalty caps at the maximum range and a target further than the maximum range cannot be targeted.
	For example, a ranged weapon with a 40/80tl. range can make attacks effectively against a creature within 40 tiles. For every tile after 40 the weapon has a -1 to its attack rolls, and a creature 81 tiles away cannot be targeted at all.

Types of Movement
General Knowledge
	The vast majority of creatures have some form of movement and many can move in ways others cannot when in terrains they excel in. Types of movement other than walking include jumping, climbing, swimming, tunneling, hovering, and flying. Each is its own method of traversing a given terrain whether it's tunneling through dirt, treading open water, or flying through the air.
Common and Uncommon Movement Types
	Since there are many types of movement, they are divided into the common and uncommon sub-groups. The main difference between them is common movement tiles can be gained by any creature with walking tiles. Therefor, all player characters have these types of movement tiles to some extent, or at least can easily gain them with their Strength Dice (climbing).
Common Movement Tiles
- Walking - The most common form of movement, walking is a simplified term for how fast a creature moves around flat, solid terrain naturally.
- Jumping - Creatures with jumping tiles can expend these tiles to jump both vertically and diagonally without rolling to determine success. A creature that has walking tiles automatically gains one jumping tile. For every two Strength Dice a creature has it gains an additional jumping tile. If a creature attempts to jump a distance larger than the sum of its jumping tiles, it can roll a Strength check with a VT equal to the number of tiles attempted to jump (x) minus the amount of jumping tiles expended (y) multiplied by 5 ((x-y)5).
- Climbing - Creatures with climbing tiles can expend them to climb up walls and ceilings without rolling to determine success. For every Strength Die a creature with walking tiles has it gains one climbing tile. If a creature attempts to climb a distance larger than the sum of its climbing tiles, it can roll a Strength check with a VT equal to the number of tiles attempted to climb (x) minus the amount of climbing tiles expended (y) multiplied by 5 ((x-y)5).
- Swimming - Creatures with swimming tiles can expend them to swim in any direction it chooses. A creature with walking tiles can swim, and has an amount of swimming tiles equal to half its walking tiles rounded down with a minimum of 1.
Uncommon Movement Tiles
- Tunneling - Creatures with tunneling tiles can expend them to tunnel through solid surfaces. This can be used to break through walls, ceilings, and floors but traditionally it is used to move beneath solid surfaces without restriction. Certain creatures can only tunnel through specific materials meaning a creature with tunneling tiles will have a note describing what those tunneling tiles can be used to tunnel through. For example one creature might only be able to tunnel through loose soils and sands, while another may be strong enough to burrow through solid rock or metal.
- Hovering - Creatures with hovering tiles can expend them to hover at a specified maximum distance above the ground. Creatures with hovering tiles normally use them in place of their walking tiles, and some have no walking tiles at all and depend entirely on hovering. A creature that does not expend at least one hovering tile on its turn while in the air will begin to fall.
- Flying - Creatures with flying tiles can expend them to fly in any direction they choose. A creature that does not expend at least one flying tile on its turn while in the air will begin to fall.

Having Multiple Movement Types
	Most creatures have more than one type of movement. Creatures with more than one type of movement tile subtract them from the movement type it has the most tiles of, they are not additive. If a creature has multiple of the same amount of movement tiles (Ex: walking 10tls., swimming 10tls., flying 10tls.) they simply subtract from each other. The movement type a creature has the most tiles of is commonly referred to as its "maximum movement".
	For example, the creature described above could fly for 3tls., walk for 3tls., and then swim for 4tls. It can't move 30tls. with each type of movement individually because they subtract from each other. A more simple example, a creature with ten walking tiles and one jumping tile can jump one tile and then walk nine tiles. Expending the one jumping tile also expended one walking tile because walking is the movement type this creature has the most tiles of.

Falling
	Creatures and objects in free fall cannot use any movement tiles other than flying and hovering, and can fall a distance of five tiles before taking damage. For every tile it falls after that it takes 1d4 damage upon hitting a surface unless prevented by some means. A creature or object falls ten tiles per turn, and takes this movement at the ends of each turn in a combat until it is no longer falling.

Temporary Movement
	Some abilities will grant "temp tiles" which means the movement tiles specified by the ability are temporarily increased (or decreased) by a certain amount until a specified amount of time passes. If a the type of movement isn't stated the temp tiles are added to the movement type which you have the most tiles of. The total amount of movement tiles you have is increased as well as the immediate amount you have.
	For example, John hasn't taken his turn yet and has expended all of his 10 walking tiles. An enemy attacks him, and he takes the Dodge action. The Dodge action grants 2 temp walking tiles till the end of your next turn which means that John currently has 2 walking tiles and 12 walking tiles total.

Moving Through A Creature's Space
	You can move through a creature's space without being impeded if it is willing. If the creature is not willing to let you move through its space, moving through its space costs double movement tiles. You cannot end your turn while occupying the same tile as a creature, regardless of whether it's willing or not.
