Level 1
Prowess Dice | Handgun
	You have 1 Prowess Die when using a Handgun weapon. You get an additional Prowess Die at levels 4, 8, 12, and 16.
Handgun Maneuverability
	You do not apply any Negative Dice to your attacks with Handgun weapons as a result of being tackled or knocked Prone. Additionally, when taking a defensive action against a Disarm action targeted at your handgun you can add your Handgun Prowess Dice to the roll.

Level 3
Handgun Versatility
	When you take your attack action during your turn with a Handgun weapon while you have another Handgun weapon in a different hand you can choose to roll only your Handgun Prowess Dice for the action. When taking the Strike or Quickdraw action in this way you must roll all your Prowess Dice. Using your Handgun Prowess Dice in this way does not expend them. Additionally, when taking an attack action with a Handgun weapon if you have an open hand you can use it to stabilize your weapon, doubling the results of Prowess Dice expended on the roll.

Level 7
Rapid-shot | 5 Poise points | Attack action
	When taking the Rapid-shot action, roll a Perception Handgun weapon attack against the target. If the total meets or exceeds the target's Hit VT you deal the weapon's damage. If your handgun has multiple shots in its magazine you can choose to shoot multiple times, as many times as your magazine capacity allows. For every additional shot taken after the first apply a -5 penalty to the roll, if the attack hits the target they take the weapon's damage for every shot used. Taking the Reload action does not interrupt this action. Additionally, when taking this action with a Handgun weapon with a magazine capacity of 1 you can reload it once for free after firing it as part of this action.

Level 11
Quickdraw
	Your first Strike action with a Handgun weapon during the Dusk round cannot be forced to miss with a defensive action. You can use a Handgun weapon to take the Parry action, successfully parrying in this way disarms the target as if by the Disarm action. Holstering and un-holstering Handgun weapons with your Free action never expends Trait Dice, it is always free regardless of how many times you do it.

Level 15
Deadeye
	Your first Strike action with a Handgun weapon on your turn automatically critically succeeds. Additionally, when taking the Rapid-shot action, you only apply a negative penalty for each shot after the third instead of each shot after the second.
