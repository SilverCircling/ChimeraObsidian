Level 1
Prowess Dice | Long Blunt
	You have 1 Prowess Die when using a Long Blunt weapon. You get an additional Prowess Die at levels 4, 8, 12, and 16.
Heavy Hitter
	You can use a Long Blunt weapon to take the Shove action. When taking the Shove action in this way you deal half weapon damage to the target.

Level 3
Wrecking Ball
	Hitting a Strike action with a Long Blunt weapon during the same round in which you've taken fall damage transfers half of the damage taken to the target creature as part of the weapon damage. Moving or taking any other action beside the Strike action once you begin your turn negates this bonus. Additionally, you deal double damage to inanimate structures and objects with Long Blunt weapons.

Level 7
Whirlwind | 5 Poise points | Attack action
	When taking the Whirlwind action, roll a Strength or Dexterity Long Blunt weapon attack against all creatures within your weapon's range. If the total meets or exceeds a target's Hit VT it deals damage and knocks the target 1 tile away from you. While making this attack your range is considered 1 tile further.

Level 11
Heaviest Hitter
	Shove actions using Long Blunt weapons deal full damage instead of half damage and move the target by 6 tiles instead of 3. Additionally, critical successes on Shove actions using Long Blunt weapons also knock the target Prone.

Level 15
Unstoppable Force
	A creature that takes the Parry or Block action against a Long Blunt weapon attack from you suffers from the Staggered (2) status effect until the start of your next turn.
