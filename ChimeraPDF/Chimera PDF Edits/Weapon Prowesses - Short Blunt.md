Level 1
Prowess Dice | Short Blunt
	You have 1 Prowess Die when using a Short Blunt weapon. You get an additional Prowess Die at levels 4, 8, 12, and 16.
Knee-capper
	You can use a Short Blunt weapon to take the Trip action. When taking the Trip action in this way you deal half weapon damage to the target.

Level 3
Bone Breaker
	After you deal damage to a creature with a Short Blunt weapon that creature takes 2 bleed damage for every tile it expends, or is moved by, till the end of your next turn. Additionally, if during this timeframe it takes a defensive action it gains the Hemorrhaged status effect. The creature must have bones or something similar to suffer from this effect.

Level 7
Flurry | 5 Poise points | Attack action
	When taking the Flurry action, roll a Strength or Dexterity Short Blunt weapon attack against the target and double the result. Divide the total by your target's Hit VT, for every success (whole number) you deal the weapon's damage. Defensive actions work differently against this attack, if the target takes a defensive action against this attack it subtracts the defensive action total from the Flurry action total *after* it has been doubled but *before* it's divided. You cannot expend additional Poise points on this action to succeed on a failure, neither can the target expend addition Poise points on its defensive action. Additionally, this action cannot critically succeed.

Level 11
Maelstrom
	Trip actions with Short Blunt weapons deal full damage instead of half damage and defensive actions against them expend 2 of the movement tile type the creature has the most of. If the creature has no movement tiles to expend it can't a defensive action against your Trip action. Additionally, when you apply the Prone condition the creature has 2 Negative Dice applied to its attack actions instead of 1 Negative Die.

Level 15
Skull Cracker
	Successful Strike actions with Short Blunt weapons can apply the Blinded or Deafened condition, your choice. Additionally, the bleed damage applied by Bone Breaker is increased to 3 bleed damage per tile instead of 2.
