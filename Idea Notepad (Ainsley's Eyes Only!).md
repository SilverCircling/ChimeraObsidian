A visual bestiary including pictures of pawprints or other means of tracking specific creatures, as well as traits to look for in order to identify certain creatures. Identifying creatures is helpful because it helps with preparation and strategy, especially considering every creature should have some kind of weakness however literal or esoteric it is. Take inspiration from Phasmophobia in particular with the possible overlapping of traits but persistence allows narrowing possibilities down. This really makes it feel like a gameplay mechanic than a glorified dictionary.
Misc Monster Notes (Insanity):
- What would a creature with no through holes look like? Completely armored? How would it eat? How would it reproduce? (bed bug style)

Maybe go back to the idea of entertaining different "realms" or "planes", perhaps rifts opened for some reason during the war that lead to other failed angel experiment worlds.
- Desert world made completely barren by a species of extremely aggressive and adaptive bug aliens, similar to xenomorphs from alien or kythons from d&d

TAKE INSPIRATION FROM STALKER, METRO, AND PACIFIC DRIVE!!!! Specifically the anomalies! If the angels fucked with evolution then they can fuck with other things like physics. Side thought: bdellans are unique mutants because they can control their mutations without the profound side effects of radiation poisoning. This means normal mutants are only possible because the rapid evolution has coincided with the effects of radiation to essentially allow a creature and its offspring to evolve faster than it can mutate which has allowed them to adapt to the effects of the radiation and use it rather than simply dying to its effects.

Drop classes entirely in favor of the simplicity of a mix and match "lineage" system instead. Relegate all the cool class ability ideas to mods instead to really drive home the idea of looting, modding, and crafting (the whole idea of being a Chimera). Makes character creation easier, makes things easier for me the creator, allows for more interesting, powerful, and unique mods rather than spending all those ideas on core class features. Don't trash current class ideas, make them either lineages or creatures in the bestiary.

(SCRAPPED, I LIKE THE D10s) Possibly drop the d10s in favor of d6s for a more practical and common dice type to reduce numerical bloat at higher stages of play. Consequently look into alternate means of applying the current "modifier dice" system.

Adopt Pathfinder's trait based rule system for ease of balance and sorting.

Look into changing critical rules, mainly how a critical success/failure is determined. The dichotomy of how impossible a critical is sometimes vs how easy they can be at other times is very jarring and not good for balance. Keeping the reduced poise cost on actions is nice, a good all around reward for criticals on actions other than dealing damage.
- Currently, rolling double the VT of a check results in a critical success, and rolling under half the VT is a critical failure. This is interesting because it makes getting a critical quite difficult but you can almost *choose* to critically succeed by expending all your dice on the one action.
BIG CHANGE!!!!!!: Change PP expenditure to simply be 1pp per 1 die expended instead of individual action poise costs. Previously expending dice and counting poise had an odd disconnect where it felt like a chore to manage not only how many dice you've expended per turn but also how much poise the action costed. Also the individual poise costs though helpful for balancing are very arbitrary and subtly discourage using your cool abilities while being hard to remember and annoying to keep track of. Change critical successes to being when a 10 is rolled on the d10 and critical failures to when a 1 is rolled. On a critical success, the die costs no poise and on a critical failure the die costs 2 poise instead of 1. THERE IS NO CRITICAL DAMAGE BONUS!!!!! We relegate that to the individual Hit VTs of a creature's different attack/weak points. Abilities that proc on high rolls that would've otherwise crit'd now just specific things like "When you roll 10 or higher over a creature's Hit VT, do x amount of extra damage" or something along those lines. This is interesting because hitting a creature in its critical weak point is more of a strategic decision to gamble than it is solely up to luck. But it also somewhat maintains the hype surrounding high rolls and the despair on low rolls. This also justifies and compliments the d10 system perfectly as anything lower is to high of a critical possibility and anything higher is either too arbitrary of a die type or is simply too high to justify rolling multiple of. Comfortably in the middle between accurate probability and rolling practicality.
Furthermore, maybe instead of the attack order of operations: attack vs. hit VT, defense vs. attack. Change it so that both parties must declare that they're attacking and more importantly the other must declare that they're defending and then they both must declare how many dice they're expending on the action all before knowing the result of the roll

Simplify the combat coin and through the night systems, if nothing else their terminology.
- Possibly drop the combat coin entirely in favor of a "shared initiative" system where before rolling initiative players can declare they want to roll together and take the average of their roll letting them share the same turn. Should fix the odd dichotomy between defense and attack "stun-lock". Must make sure to make sharing an initiative valuable in some way.
- Rename the Through the Night and round names to something more understandable and telegraphed. It is weird and needlessly cryptic.

Shift character creation mentality, requirements are okay to have. They make build making more interesting when done right, but still be careful by not overdoing it as to limit creativity and combinations too much.
- Specifically, when it comes to modding and equipment utilization as your creature type lineage thing. Machines can't use genetic mods, cyborgs easily strain themselves, etc.

Make status effects interact with actions more.

Identified Problems:
- The way trait dice and their expenditure works as of current, it restricts the mechanical viability of certain *prime* character archetypes that a player may want to embody. For example, playing a big strong mountain of a character that uses a heavy mace, shield, and heavy armor (like the traditional paladin archetype) is not viable because you are mechanically forced to choose one trait for attacking and a different trait for defending. When trying to build an effective character you are discouraged from making these two main attacking and defending traits the same trait. Ergo, it is ineffective to use the strength based mace and the strength based shield together. This is a large problem particularly because of how much it goes against the traditional sense of character and class archetypes, which quickly becomes odd, frustrating, annoying, and anti-player/fun.
	- 
- Attacking an enemy and then having them simply negate your attack with a defensive action, even if it is ultimately helpful as it drains their poise and expends their dice, does not *feel* good. Conversely, being attacked and then negating it with a defensive action does not feel as awesome and clutch as initially thought but more "matter-of-fact" and more objective than it is cool.
- Poise is ultimately a means of balancing the "day of adventure" game mentality adopted from other TTRPGs like D&D, particularly as a quick and complete means of resource management. Resource management is a lot easier to balance out of game and maintain/keep track of in game if it is simply just one resource that everything effects. In this mentality we find that the poise system is a great and grand idea that if done correctly would be perfect for people looking for a game where resource management based decision making is very important. BUT. There is one key aspect of the "day of adventure" mentality that is missing here. On the flip side, NPCs/monsters do not have days of adventure like players do. Because of this poise for NPCs is ultimately more of a hinderance on the GM's headspace, time, and balancing than it is helpful or interesting like it is for player characters. THIS IS A CRUCIAL THING TO FIX, AND VERY DIFFICULT TO FIX.

Rethink social prowesses.

Armor prowesses(?)

Rethink weapon prowesses.
- Taking the prowess only gives you the prowess dice and the special action. All other abilities can become feats, allowing for more variation and specialization. This can include general feats like being able to take the Trip action with a ranged weapon, or specific feats that require prowess to take like the existing prowess abilities.

Add create cover action.

Take inspiration from that one Elden Ring mod, specifically the concept of "generator spells". Genuinely genius, and I want to steal it. Kind of not related but also kind of related, what if you could sacrifice one of your trait dice for the rest of the adventuring day to regain some poise points. Interesting concept, cannibalizing your chances of success to stay in the fight. For example you could sacrifice one of your Dexterity trait dice until your next "long rest" and you cant use it until then, but upon sacrificing it you instantly regain 10pp.

What if there was some kind of system where players needed to be somewhere specific or interact with something specific to recover their poise and HP, completely ripping the bonfire from souls games. Would be an extremely easy way to discourage mid-adventure resting in non-time sensitive adventures. Could make it real interesting, perhaps its some kind of giant crystal or obelisk that only chimeras can tap into that they keep safe at the heart of their base of operations. There could even be some mobile, weaker version they could carry around with them but could be destroyed and leave them stranded.

INSPIRED!!!!!! What if chimeras are specifically people bestowed power over destiny as some kind of final gift to humanity by the renegade angels before they were destroyed. Chimeras are the physical embodiment of the freedom given to humanity by Lucifer. And because of whatever archaic and non-descript reasoning that is they can use these "crystals" we will call them for now because why not to recover much faster than normal people. This actually kind of plays into an aspect of the hunt I have not touched on, the art of wounding and hounding. A lot of the time after finally finding your quarry, you will injure it and it will get away and in this weakened state we continue to hunt until, in the real world, exhaustion and blood loss catch up.

REDOING CHARACTER CREATION PROCESS
- Keep weapon prowesses, possibly make them more mix and match rather than how rigid they are as of now. Possibly make even more if more can be thought of.
