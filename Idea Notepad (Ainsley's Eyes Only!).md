A visual bestiary including pictures of pawprints or other means of tracking specific creatures, as well as traits to look for in order to identify certain creatures. Identifying creatures is helpful because it helps with preparation and strategy, especially considering every creature should have some kind of weakness however literal or esoteric it is.

Drop classes entirely in favor of the simplicity of a mix and match "lineage" system instead. Relegate all the cool class ability ideas to mods instead to really drive home the idea of looting, modding, and crafting (the whole idea of being a Chimera). Makes character creation easier, makes things easier for me the creator, allows for more interesting, powerful, and unique mods rather than spending all those ideas on core class features. Don't trash current class ideas, make them either lineages or creatures in the bestiary.

Possibly drop the d10s in favor of d6s for a more practical and common dice type to reduce numerical bloat at higher stages of play. Consequently look into alternate means of applying the current "modifier dice" system.

Adopt Pathfinder's trait based rule system for ease of balance and sorting.

Look into changing critical rules, mainly how a critical success/failure is determined.

Simplify the combat coin and through the night systems, if nothing else their terminology.

Shift character creation mentality, requirements are okay to have. They make build making more interesting when done right, but still be careful by not overdoing it as to limit creativity and combinations too much.

Make status effects interact with actions more.

Rethink social prowesses.



REDOING CHARACTER CREATION PROCESS
- Keep weapon prowesses, possibly make them more mix and match rather than how rigid they are as of now. Possibly make even more if more can be thought of.
