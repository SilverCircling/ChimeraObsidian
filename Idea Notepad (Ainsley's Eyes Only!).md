A visual bestiary including pictures of pawprints or other means of tracking specific creatures, as well as traits to look for in order to identify certain creatures. Identifying creatures is helpful because it helps with preparation and strategy, especially considering every creature should have some kind of weakness however literal or esoteric it is.

Drop classes entirely in favor of the simplicity of a mix and match "lineage" system instead. Relegate all the cool class ability ideas to mods instead to really drive home the idea of looting, modding, and crafting (the whole idea of being a Chimera). Makes character creation easier, makes things easier for me the creator, allows for more interesting, powerful, and unique mods rather than spending all those ideas on core class features. Don't trash current class ideas, make them either lineages or creatures in the bestiary.
