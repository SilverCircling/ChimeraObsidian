A visual bestiary including pictures of pawprints or other means of tracking specific creatures, as well as traits to look for in order to identify certain creatures. Identifying creatures is helpful because it helps with preparation and strategy, especially considering every creature should have some kind of weakness however literal or esoteric it is.

Drop classes entirely in favor of the simplicity of a mix and match "lineage" system instead. Relegate all the cool class ability ideas to mods instead to really drive home the idea of looting, modding, and crafting (the whole idea of being a Chimera). Makes character creation easier, makes things easier for me the creator, allows for more interesting, powerful, and unique mods rather than spending all those ideas on core class features. Don't trash current class ideas, make them either lineages or creatures in the bestiary.

Possibly drop the d10s in favor of d6s for a more practical and common dice type to reduce numerical bloat at higher stages of play. Consequently look into alternate means of applying the current "modifier dice" system.

Adopt Pathfinder's trait based rule system for ease of balance and sorting.

Look into changing critical rules, mainly how a critical success/failure is determined. The dichotomy of how impossible a critical is sometimes vs how easy they can be at other times is very jarring and not good for balance. Keeping the reduced poise cost on actions is nice, a good all around reward for criticals on actions other than dealing damage.
- Currently, rolling double the VT of a check results in a critical success, and rolling under half the VT is a critical failure. 

Simplify the combat coin and through the night systems, if nothing else their terminology.
- Possibly drop the combat coin entirely in favor of a "shared initiative" system where before rolling initiative players get declare they want to roll together and take the average of their roll letting them share the same turn. Should fix the odd dichotomy between defense and attack "stun-lock". Must make sure to make sharing an initiative valuable in some way.
- Rename the Through the Night and round names to something more understandable and telegraphed. It is weird and needlessly cryptic.

Shift character creation mentality, requirements are okay to have. They make build making more interesting when done right, but still be careful by not overdoing it as to limit creativity and combinations too much.
- Specifically, when it comes to modding and equipment utilization as your creature type lineage thing. Machines can't use genetic mods, cyborgs easily strain themselves, etc.

Make status effects interact with actions more.

Identified Problems:
- The way trait dice and their expenditure works as of current, it restricts the mechanical viability of certain *prime* character archetypes that a player may want to embody. For example, playing a big strong mountain of a character that uses a heavy mace, shield, and heavy armor (like the traditional paladin archetype) is not viable because you are mechanically forced to choose one trait for attacking and a different trait for defending. When trying to build an effective character you are discouraged from making these two main attacking and defending traits the same trait. Ergo, it is ineffective to use the strength based mace and the strength based shield together. This is a large problem particularly because of how much it goes against the traditional sense of character and class archetypes, which quickly becomes odd, frustrating, annoying, and anti-player/fun.
- 

Rethink social prowesses.

Rethink weapon prowesses.
- Taking the prowess only gives you the prowess dice and the special action. All other abilities can become feats, allowing for more variation and specialization. This can include general feats like being able to take the Trip action with a ranged weapon, or specific feats that require prowess to take like the existing prowess abilities.

Add create cover action.



REDOING CHARACTER CREATION PROCESS
- Keep weapon prowesses, possibly make them more mix and match rather than how rigid they are as of now. Possibly make even more if more can be thought of.
