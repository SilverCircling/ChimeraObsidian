Hit Points
A player's Hit Points, or HP for short, is calculated differently dependent on their Level, Constitution, Skills, Modifications, and Equipment. A player's limbs have a separate pool of HP known as that limb's Damage Threshold. When the Damage Threshold of a limb reaches its breaking point, that limb cannot be used until repair.

When you take an action on your turn it expends your trait dice in that given trait and you don't get those dice again until your next turn. This balances action spamming but leaves room for tactical over expenditure of points and epic moments of going nova or self sacrifice.
Synergy Actions or Synergy Dice? BOTH!!!!!!!
Bonuses for the Neurodyad
Synergy Dice with a wide margin of no Synergy, but during downtime can train and practice together for a better chance at Synergizing.
(Crafting Synergy Actions)

Rolling a critical success (double the VT) doesn't do extra damage but instead makes the action cost no poise. This gives value to critical success on things other than damage, and still effectively doubles the damage of an attack by allowing you to attack again (since the critical success costs nothing).

Every class has four subclasses each leaning into one of the four class types (Offense, Defense, Support, Utility).
